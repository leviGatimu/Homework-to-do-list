## 🌟 Features

This isn't just a list; it's a **virtual desk**.

* **🎨 Realistic Aesthetic:** Notes are slightly rotated and textured to look like paper on a corkboard.
* **✏️ Handwritten Style:** Uses the 'Reenie Beanie' font and graphite-colored text to simulate pencil writing.
* **🍂 Gravity "Unstick" Animation:** When you delete a note, it doesn't just vanish—it falls off the screen like a real piece of paper unsticking from a wall.
* **💾 Auto-Save:** Uses **LocalStorage** so your tasks are still there even if you refresh or close the browser.
* **✅ "Done" Stamps:** Mark tasks complete with a satisfying visual stamp and strikethrough.
* **🌈 Dynamic Colors:** Notes randomly generate in Yellow, Blue, or Pink.
